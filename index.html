    Theme chosen: Astra free theme
    Plugin chosen: WP Super Cache
    Reason for selection and effects on the WordPress site
    I selected the Astra free theme because it is lightweight and offers extensive layout and customization options that work well with page builders and native WordPress customizer controls. I selected WP Super Cache because it improves performance by serving static HTML versions of pages to reduce server processing on repeat visits. After activating Astra I explored the customizer and adjusted header layout, typography, and colors to match the site goals. After installing and activating WP Super Cache I validated that caching is enabled and confirmed faster page load times for repeat visits which improved perceived performance and lowered server load.
